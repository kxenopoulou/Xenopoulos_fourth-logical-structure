2. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION: Dialectics as an Evolutionary Process
2.1 The Classical Dialectical Triad (Hegel → Marx)
Dialectical evolution, as formulated by Hegel and adapted by Marx, describes a triadic process:
1.	THESIS (status quo) - the existing state
2.	ANTITHESIS (negation of thesis) - conflict with contradictory elements
3.	SYNTHESIS (overcoming antithesis) - the new, higher equilibrium
2.2 Jean Piaget's Contribution
Piaget developed cognitive development theory based on four fundamental operators:
•	I (Identity) - Identity
•	N (Negation) - Negation
•	R (Reciprocity) - Reversibility
•	C (Correlation) - Correlation
________________________________________
3. THE MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK: The Klein-4 Group
3.1 Algebraic Properties
The INRC operators form a Klein-4 Group with the following properties:
•	Closure: For every a,b∈Ga,b∈G, a∘b∈Ga∘b∈G
•	Associativity: (a∘b)∘c=a∘(b∘c)(a∘b)∘c=a∘(b∘c)
•	Identity Element: ∃e:e∘a=a∘e=a∃e:e∘a=a∘e=a
•	Inverse Element: ∀a∃a−1:a∘a−1=e∀a∃a−1:a∘a−1=e
•	Self-inversibility: N∘N=IN∘N=I, R∘R=IR∘R=I, C∘C=IC∘C=I
3.2 Operation Table (Cayley Table)
∘	I	N	R	C
I	I	N	R	C
N	N	I	C	R
R	R	C	I	N
C	C	R	N	I
3.3 Modeling the Dialectical Triad
•	Thesis → Operator I: I(f)=fI(f)=f (initial state)
•	Antithesis → Operator N: N(f)=−fN(f)=−f (negation)
•	Synthesis → Operator C/R: C(f)=f⊕−fC(f)=f⊕−f (new totality)

5.3 Type Δ: Precise Mathematical Definition
Differential Form:
ddtΔ(f)(t)=L[f(t),dfdt,H(t)]dtdΔ(f)(t)=L[f(t),dtdf,H(t)]

11. FINAL SYNTHESIS: DIALECTICS AS A SCIENTIFIC PARADIGM
The proposed theory is not merely another method, but a new scientific paradigm:
Existing methods explain what happens.
Xenopoulos's dialectics explains why it happens and when it will happen again.
This framework:
1.	Connects philosophy with science through rigorous mathematics
2.	Provides predictive tools for complex systems
3.	Opens new avenues for interdisciplinary research
4.	Creates a bridge between humanities and natural sciences
Mathematical dialectics emerges as a powerful tool for understanding and predicting evolution at all levels of reality.
